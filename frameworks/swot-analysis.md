# SWOT Analysis Framework

## Framework Overview

**Purpose**: Examine internal strengths and weaknesses alongside external opportunities and threats to provide a comprehensive strategic view of a decision.

**Best Used For**:
- Strategic planning decisions
- Business or career moves
- Competitive situations
- Evaluating readiness for change
- Identifying strategic positioning

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Strengths (Internal Positive Factors)

What advantages do you have for making this decision?

**Consider**:
- Resources you possess (time, money, skills, relationships)
- Your unique capabilities or expertise
- Past successes in similar situations
- Support systems available
- Competitive advantages
- Existing infrastructure or foundations

**For Each Strength**:
- Describe it clearly
- Rate its significance (1-5)
- Explain how it helps this decision

### Step 2: Identify Weaknesses (Internal Negative Factors)

What disadvantages or limitations do you face?

**Consider**:
- Resource constraints (time, money, skills, knowledge)
- Past failures or setbacks in similar areas
- Personal limitations or gaps
- Lack of experience or expertise
- Competing priorities or commitments
- Dependencies on others

**For Each Weakness**:
- Describe it honestly
- Rate its severity (1-5)
- Explain how it hinders this decision
- Note if it's addressable

### Step 3: Identify Opportunities (External Positive Factors)

What favorable external conditions exist?

**Consider**:
- Market trends or timing
- Regulatory or policy changes
- Technological advancements
- Network or partnership possibilities
- Emerging needs or gaps
- First-mover advantages
- Favorable economic conditions

**For Each Opportunity**:
- Describe the external factor
- Rate its potential impact (1-5)
- Explain how you could leverage it
- Note the window of opportunity

### Step 4: Identify Threats (External Negative Factors)

What external risks or obstacles exist?

**Consider**:
- Competition or opposition
- Market shifts or economic conditions
- Regulatory or legal risks
- Technological disruption
- Timing or deadline pressures
- External dependencies
- Environmental or systemic risks

**For Each Threat**:
- Describe the external risk
- Rate its severity (1-5)
- Explain its potential impact
- Note if it's mitigable

### Step 5: Strategic Analysis

**Match Strategy**: How can you use Strengths to capitalize on Opportunities?

**Convert Strategy**: How can you use Strengths to mitigate Threats?

**Address Strategy**: How can you overcome Weaknesses to pursue Opportunities?

**Defend Strategy**: How can you minimize Weaknesses and avoid Threats?

### Step 6: Scoring

Calculate component scores:
- **Strength Score** = Sum of all strength ratings
- **Weakness Score** = Sum of all weakness ratings
- **Opportunity Score** = Sum of all opportunity ratings
- **Threat Score** = Sum of all threat ratings

**Total Positive** = Strength Score + Opportunity Score
**Total Negative** = Weakness Score + Threat Score

**Net Strategic Position** = Total Positive - Total Negative

**Final Score (0-100)** = 50 + (Net Strategic Position × 2)
- Capped at 100 (maximum) and 0 (minimum)

**Score Interpretation**:
- 80-100: Very strong strategic position
- 60-79: Favorable strategic position
- 40-59: Balanced position, success depends on execution
- 20-39: Challenging strategic position
- 0-19: Very weak strategic position

- **Primary Risk**: [Which threat requires most attention and why]

### Recommendation

Based on SWOT analysis: [Clear statement about strategic viability of this decision]
```

## Analysis Guidelines

**Balance**: Aim for similar numbers of items in each quadrant (3-7 items per quadrant is ideal).

**Specificity**: Avoid vague statements like "good skills" - be specific about which skills and why they matter.

**Objectivity**: Be honest about weaknesses and threats. Self-deception undermines the analysis.

**External vs Internal**: Keep the distinction clear:
- Internal = things you control (S/W)
- External = things in your environment (O/T)

**Prioritize**: Not all factors are equal. Use the rating system to indicate relative importance.

**Actionability**: Focus on factors you can actually leverage or address, not abstract concepts.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Confusing internal and external factors
- Being too optimistic about strengths, too pessimistic about weaknesses
- Listing too many trivial factors instead of focusing on significant ones
- Failing to connect factors to actual strategic actions
- Ignoring the timing element (some opportunities/threats are time-sensitive)
- Not considering the interplay between quadrants
